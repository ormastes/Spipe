# Coding — Simple Language Rules for Codex

**Cooperative Phase:** All phases (always active when writing code)
**Self-sufficient.** Reference rules for any code-writing task.

## Reference

Full syntax: `doc/07_guide/quick_reference/syntax_quick_reference.md`

## Configured variants and compiler generations

For library-owner or aggregate repairs, read
`doc/07_guide/compiler/configured_variants_and_aggregate_validation.md`.
Preserve configured implementation selection and importer family behind stable
interfaces; fallback ordering must not override them. Do not globally pin a
GC/concurrency family to hide a resolver defect. Rust/Pure-Simple selection
parity is active work, not a verified property. Bind failures and tests to the
actual producer, source, backend, linked runtime/provider, and cache scope;
old producers can repeat failures despite newer source fixes. Validate actual
array/tuple values, negative contracts and real test counts, not file counts.

## Core Syntax

### Variables

```simple
val name = "Alice"             # Immutable (preferred)
# name := "Alice"              # Walrus shorthand is not currently proven; use val
var count = 0                  # Mutable
```

### Strings

```simple
print "Hello, {name}!"        # String interpolation (default)
print r"raw: \d+"              # Raw string (no interpolation)
```

### Logging and Print

- Use `print` only for scripts, examples, tests, and intentionally human-facing CLI output.
- In `src/app/`, `src/lib/`, and `src/compiler/`, prefer structured logging calls: `log`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, or `trace`.
- `debug`/`trace` are for diagnostic detail and must be safe to compile out or suppress in production paths.
- Hardware access, external process/file/network access, and trace capture should log through the AOP/debug logging path when available so human and LLM log modes can fold/group it.
- `simple lint` emits `LOG001` when production source uses bare `print`; script-style `print` remains allowed outside production source roots.
- In app leaf code, use `app.io.mod` env/process facades such as
  `process_run_timeout`, `process_spawn_async`, `process_spawn_async_env`,
  `process_wait`, `process_is_running`, `process_is_alive`, and `process_kill`;
  do not declare local `rt_process_*` externs outside owner modules.

### Functions

```simple
fn square(x):
    x * x                      # Implicit return

fn add(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64:
    a + b
```

### Generics

**Use `<>` for type parameters; use `[]` for array types/literals:**
```simple
Option<T>
Map<String, Int>
Result<T, E>
[i64]
[T]
```

### Classes (NO INHERITANCE)

```simple
class Point:
    x: i64
    y: i64
    fn get_x() -> i64: self.x          # Immutable method
    me move(dx: i64):                   # Mutable method ('me' keyword)
        self.x = self.x + dx
    static fn origin() -> Point:        # Static method
        Point(x: 0, y: 0)
```

**`class Child(Parent)` is NOT supported.** Use:
- Composition
- Alias forwarding
- Traits
- Mixins

### Constructors

```simple
Point(x: 3, y: 4)             # Named fields — NOT .new()
```

### Pattern Binding

```simple
if val x = optional_value:     # NOT 'if let'
    process(x)
```

### Error Handling

```simple
# Use Result<T, E> + ? operator (no try/catch/throw)
fn read_file(path: text) -> Result<text, Error>:
    val content = fs.read(path)?
    Ok(content)
```

### Match

```simple
match value:
    Some(x): process(x)
    nil: ()                    # Unit value
```

### Lambdas

```simple
items.map(\x: x * 2)          # Lambda
items.map(_ * 2)               # Placeholder lambda
items.map(_1 * 10)             # Numbered placeholder
words.map(&:len)               # Method reference
```

### Short Grammar Use

Use compact grammar when it removes local boilerplate without hiding control flow:

```simple
fn double(x: i64) -> i64: x * 2              # Expression-bodied function
items.map(_ * 2)                              # Single-argument transform
items.zip(other).map(_1 + _2)                 # Short tuple/zip transform
words.map(&:len)                              # Method reference
[for x in items if x > 0: x * x]              # Comprehension
value ?? fallback                             # Nil coalescing
```

Prefer explicit forms when the expression has side effects, more than one decision point,
or needs clear runtime support in native mode:

```simple
items.map(\x:
    val scaled = x * factor
    scaled + offset
)
```

- Do not use `:=` in new code until parser/runtime tests prove the actual token works; use `val`.
- Treat `|>` pipe-forward dispatch as interpreter-supported unless native tests pass with `SIMPLE_NO_STUB_FALLBACK=1`.
- For native-targeted code, prefer expression-bodied functions, comprehensions, and direct calls over pipe chains.

### Comprehensions

```simple
[for x in 0..10 if x % 2 == 0: x]
```

### Optional Chaining

```simple
user?.name ?? "Anonymous"      # Optional chaining + nil coalescing
```

### Operators

```simple
x |> transform                 # Pipe
f >> g                         # Compose
layer1 ~> layer2               # Layer connect
2 ** 10                        # Power
m{ x^2 + y^2 }                # Math block
```

### Pass Variants

```simple
pass_todo("what remains", "hint or issue")
pass_do_nothing("why no-op is correct")
pass_dn("why no-op is correct")
todo("what remains", "hint or issue")
case _("why catch-all is correct"):
pass                           # Generic no-op
```

### Type Aliases

```simple
type Point2D = Point           # Type alias
alias Optional = Option        # Class alias
```

## Runtime Limitations (CRITICAL)

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|-----------|
| Multi-line booleans | Wrap in parentheses: `if (a and\n   b):` |
| Nested closure capture | Can READ outer vars, CANNOT MODIFY (module closures work fine) |
| Chained methods broken | Use intermediate `var` |
| `?` in names | Not allowed — `?` is operator only; use `.?` over `is_*` predicates |
| `:=` walrus shorthand | Use `val name = expr` until real `:=` parser/runtime tests pass |
| Native pipe-forward dispatch | Use direct calls or run native tests with `SIMPLE_NO_STUB_FALLBACK=1` |

## Concurrency API Map

When investigating Simple concurrency, search the API names as well as runtime
terms like fiber or scheduler. The implemented stdlib surfaces are split by
execution model:

| API | Path | Model |
|-----|------|-------|
| `thread_spawn` / `ThreadHandle` | `src/lib/nogc_async_mut/concurrent/thread.spl` and `thread_sffi.spl` | OS thread (`pthread_create` / `CreateThread`) |
| `cooperative_green_spawn` / `cooperative_green_spawn_value` / `GreenThreadHandle` / `cooperative_green_run_one` / `cooperative_green_run_all` | `src/lib/nogc_async_mut/concurrent/cooperative_green.spl` over `green_thread.spl` | Cooperative green-thread queue on the current OS thread; no preemption or CPU parallelism |
| `green_channel_new` / `green_channel_recv` / `green_channel_send` | `src/lib/nogc_async_mut/concurrent/green_channel.spl` | Pure Simple nonblocking green-channel contract; recv parks a logical green task, send unparks a waiter or reports bounded backpressure |
| `multicore_green_spawn` / `multicore_green_spawn_sliced` / `multicore_green_safepoint` / `multicore_green_set_parallelism` / `multicore_green_parallelism` / `multicore_green_submitted_count` / `multicore_green_completed_count` / `multicore_green_pending_count` / `multicore_green_busy_count` / `multicore_green_blocked_count` / `MulticoreGreenHandle.used_runtime_pool()` / `MulticoreGreenHandle.ran_inline_fallback()` / `MulticoreGreenSliceResult` / `MulticoreGreenSlicedHandle.used_runtime_pool()` / `MulticoreGreenSlicedHandle.ran_inline_fallback()` | `src/lib/nogc_async_mut/concurrent/multicore_green.spl` | Pure Simple bounded-worker facade over runtime-seed `rt_pool_*` support; cross-language profile rows require runtime-pool acceptance through `used_runtime_pool()` and treat `ran_inline_fallback()` as non-M:N. Public counter helpers expose submitted/completed progress and queue/worker state; they do not prove ordinary-closure preemption. `multicore_green_spawn_sliced` is the explicit scalar-state fairness API for long hosted work; `multicore_green_safepoint` is an explicit runtime/compiler poll hook, not automatic preemption for ordinary closures |
| `task_spawn` / `TaskHandle` | `src/lib/nogc_async_mut/thread_pool.spl` | Lower-level task facade that reuses `multicore_green_spawn` for runtime-pool execution and inline fallback; not the named cross-language M:N profile row |
| `channel_new` / `channel_from_id` | `src/lib/nogc_sync_mut/concurrent/channel.spl` re-exported through `std.concurrent.channel` | Native compatibility channel: validated inline transfer packets, capacity 256, and fail-closed full/closed/non-transferable sends. Heap graphs require future typed frozen/owned/encoded payload support. |

### SimpleRing/task/profile V1 foundation

The V1 async foundation is a contract and bounded-lifecycle layer, not a new
executor. Keep these surfaces distinct from the Future/green/thread APIs above:

| API/contract | Path | Model and current boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `SimpleRing<Op, Cpl>` | `src/lib/nogc_async_mut/async_ring/simple_ring.spl` | Fixed-capacity, single-owner lifecycle with metadata/payload leases, batches, cancellation state, and bounded telemetry; no scheduler or native provider |
| `RingToken`, `StacklessAsyncTask`, `AsyncTaskFrame`, `TaskContext`, `TaskPollResult` | `src/lib/common/contracts/execution/simple_ring_async_v1.spl` | Versioned ring/task values and callable nonblocking poll contract; not compiler-generated lowering |
| `AsyncProfile` V1 presets | `src/lib/common/contracts/execution/async_profile_v1.spl` | Configuration, fail-closed validation, canonical text, and fingerprints; mission presets do not implement static storage or a migrated executor |
| Software provider, hosted mission adapter, trace ring | `src/lib/nogc_async_mut/async_ring`, `src/lib/nogc_async_mut_noalloc/async/async_trace_ring.spl` | Bounded reference mechanisms whose explicit proof flags do not claim native mapping, allocation freedom, or link-time-static placement |

The V1 foundation does not make `Future`, `HostFuture`, `cooperative_green_spawn`,
`multicore_green_spawn`, `task_spawn`, or `thread_spawn` canonical. Adapters
must preserve each surface's blocking, fallback, ownership, cancellation, and
completion facts before it can be used as V1 evidence. Do not claim implicit
await/compiler frame lowering, native `io_uring`, mission static storage, or
migrated executors without executable gates.

Use `cooperative_green_spawn` for lightweight cooperative scheduling tests, and
`cooperative_green_spawn_value` when a direct-run benchmark needs to exercise
the queue without delayed function-valued storage. Function-valued parameters
and local/global function arrays and globals are native-covered, and
function-valued globals/global arrays are direct-run covered. SMF
function-valued global/global-array storage remains a separate delayed-storage
blocker. Do not use either cooperative API for Go-style M:N
CPU-parallel benchmarks. Use
`multicore_green_spawn` for current cross-language Go-like benchmark work. Treat
`multicore_green_spawn` as the Pure Simple user API and `rt_pool_*` as
runtime-seed support, not as a combined user-facing API. Use
`multicore_green_spawn_sliced(initial_state, step_fn)` when a long task can
yield by returning `MulticoreGreenSliceResult.continue_with(next_state)`, use
`task_spawn` only for direct task API checks, or use a future scheduler-aware
green runtime when that lands. When a test or profile claims M:N CPU
parallelism, assert `used_runtime_pool()` so interpreter or platform fallback
does not masquerade as a parallel result. For native runtime-pool evidence, also
check submitted/completed deltas and pending/busy/blocked counters through the
public `multicore_green_*_count` helpers; do not import direct `rt_pool_*`
symbols from user code.
Call `multicore_green_set_parallelism(workers)` before the first
`multicore_green_spawn` when a profile needs an explicit hosted pool limit.
Non-positive requests clamp to `1` at the Pure Simple boundary. Record
`multicore_green_parallelism()` in evidence. Cross-language profile
evidence must also show Go `GOMAXPROCS` pinned to the same `CPU_WORKERS` value.
Live pools can grow but do not claim shrink/preemption behavior yet.
Use the canonical profile gates when changing these surfaces:
`test/05_perf/profile_scripts/profile_report_contract_test.shs` checks OS
thread, cooperative green, multicore green, C pthread, Go goroutine, RSS,
GOMAXPROCS, `used_runtime_pool()` report evidence, public runtime-pool counter
delta evidence, and in no-arg canonical mode the `doc/09_report/README.md`
report index plus `doc/03_plan/agent_tasks/multicore_green.md` handoff via
`report_index_checked=doc/09_report/README.md` and
`agent_task_plan_checked=doc/03_plan/agent_tasks/multicore_green.md`;
`test/05_perf/profile_scripts/profile_report_contract_negative_test.shs`
checks the stale/misleading failure cases, including exact public counter
evidence such as
`counter_delta=submitted/completed,pending=0,busy=0,blocked=0`;
`test/05_perf/profile_scripts/profile_help_contract_test.shs` keeps `--help`
inspection from starting expensive profile compilation;
`test/05_perf/profile_scripts/profile_binary_autoselect_test.shs` keeps stale
release wrappers from being selected over the current Simple binary;
`test/05_perf/stress/multicore_green_large_profile_gate_spec.spl` gates the
checked large-fanout/stress profile evidence; and
`test/05_perf/profile_scripts/concurrency_api_contract_test.shs` checks
approved public concurrency names, wrong-surface imports, direct runtime-pool
access, shared mutable green captures, and numeric-suffix aliases across active
source/profile surfaces;
`test/05_perf/profile_scripts/profile_docker_isolation_contract_test.shs`
checks that crash-prone profile runs stay behind the existing
`PROFILE_DOCKER_ISOLATION=1` Docker boundary instead of using a separate
harness.

Do not use numeric-suffix concurrency aliases. They are rejected by
`simple check` with `E-PAR-002`; use `thread_spawn_with_args`,
`spawn_isolated_with_args`, or `spawn_limited_with_args` for
explicit-argument spawning.
Keep concurrency surfaces separate. Importing `thread_spawn` from
`std.concurrent.cooperative_green`, importing `cooperative_green_spawn` from
`std.concurrent.thread`, importing `multicore_green_spawn` from
`std.concurrent.thread`, importing `multicore_green_spawn_sliced` from
`std.concurrent.thread`, or similar wrong-surface imports is rejected with
`E-PAR-003`. Passing non-closures to `thread_spawn`, `green_spawn`,
`cooperative_green_spawn`, or `multicore_green_spawn`, or passing text to
`multicore_green_set_parallelism`, is rejected with `E-PAR-004`.
`multicore_green_spawn_sliced` requires an integer initial state plus a step
function and rejects wrong arity, non-integer state, or non-function step
arguments with `E-PAR-004`.
Green tasks are share-nothing: a `green_spawn`, `cooperative_green_spawn`, or
`multicore_green_spawn` closure must not read module-level mutable `var`s or
write captured `var`s. Inline `multicore_green_spawn_sliced` step lambdas must
follow the same rule. Violations are rejected with `E-PAR-006`. Pass values in
as locals, return results from the closure, or advance sliced state through
`MulticoreGreenSliceResult`. `thread_spawn` is exempt (OS threads may share via
Mutex).

## Reserved Keywords

These CANNOT be used as identifiers:

`gen`, `val`, `def`, `exists`, `actor`, `assert`, `join`, `pass_todo`, `pass_do_nothing`, `pass_dn`

## File Organization

- All code in `.spl` files
- Shell scripts in `.shs` files (only for container entrypoints)
- Config/data in SDN format (not JSON/YAML)
- No Python, no Bash scripts (except 3 bootstrap scripts in `scripts/`)
- Files > 800 lines must be split

## Import Conventions

```simple
use std.io                     # Standard library (preferred)
use lib.common.text            # Also works (std -> lib internally)
```

`use std.X` and `use lib.X` both resolve from `src/lib/`. Prefer `use std.X` in new code.

## TODO Rules

- NEVER convert TODO/FIXME to NOTE — that hides work
- Either implement the TODO or delete the code entirely
- If a TODO cannot be implemented yet, leave it as TODO

## Code Quality

- NEVER over-engineer — only make requested changes
- NEVER add unused code — delete completely
- STUB001 = hard fail — no `pass_todo` in production code

## Implementation Language Policy (Pure Simple First)

- Never write a C version of a fix/feature when pure Simple can do it. Only the
  Rust seed and the 3 bootstrap scripts are sanctioned non-Simple code; the C
  runtime is a boundary, not a place for logic.
- Bootstrap-required C keeps a pure-Simple twin, verified by the dual-run
  shadow gate `scripts/check/check-dual-run-shadow.shs`.
- HAL/low-level code minimizes asm: typed bitfield register views + MMIO-typed
  access > no-reorder/no-elide/exact-layout tags or strict mode > compiler
  intrinsics > inline asm only for architecturally irreplaceable ops (boot
  entry, CSR/MSR, context switch, interrupt entry, ISA-required
  barriers/atomics).

Full policy: `doc/07_guide/os/hal/pure_simple_hal.md`.
