# Dev Skill — Full Feature Development

`/dev` runs the full SStack feature-development pipeline: intake, research,
architecture/design, SPipe specs, implementation, refactor, verification, and
ship handoff. The SPipe-prefixed alias is `/sp_dev`.

This is separate from `/spipe`, which is the focused BDD/spec-writing skill used
inside the pipeline.

## Usage

```
/dev <description of what to build or fix>
/sp_dev <description of what to build or fix>
```

Argument: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Dispatch

Read `.claude/skills/sstack.md` and execute its full orchestrator procedure
with the user request. No differences — `/dev`, `/sp_dev`, and `/sstack` are
the same full feature-development pipeline.

## When to Use

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Any dev task (bug fix, feature, refactor, TODO) | `/dev`, `/sp_dev`, or `/sstack` |
| BDD/spec authoring only | `/spipe` |
| Large feature needing 15-phase doc artifacts | `/impl` |
| Research only, no implementation | `/research` |
| Design only, implementation later | `/design` |
| Post-implementation verification audit | `/verify` |

## SPipe self-review admission

GitHub forbids a pull-request author from submitting an `APPROVED` review on
their own pull request. Do not retry or claim a provider approval. SPipe uses a
different merge gate: the pinned broker emits the short-lived required check
`SPipe Self Review Admission` for one exact head, base, diff, and ruleset.

If an agent asks to **self approve**, **approve PR**, or says the **author
cannot approve**, run the one discovery command `spipe self-review-guide` (or
`node cli/spipe.js self-review-guide` from this checkout). Then follow this
exact workflow:

1. Before review, capture the live PR head as `HEAD_SHA`. Perform a `high`,
   `xhigh`, `max`, or `ultra` review of that captured SHA. Record the session, model, effort, verdict, and
   finding counts; continue only for `PASS` with `P0=0` and `P1=0`.
2. Choose one protected implementation. Generic SPipe MCP callers invoke
   `spipe_self_review_privilege_evaluate` and, only on allow, invoke
   `spipe_self_review_approve` with the same closed request. A Simple-hosted
   repository instead lets its trusted default-branch workflow perform that
   policy resolution. Do not combine or reorder these two paths.
3. For Simple, capture before the review with `HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --repo ormastes/simple --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)`. Dispatch only through a configured broker that authenticates a canonical v2 policy DB and an exact higher-model receipt. If the workflow offers only a `self_attestation` input, stop: that legacy path cannot supply broker-signed evidence and must not emit admission.
4. Poll only `repos/ormastes/simple/commits/$HEAD_SHA/check-runs?check_name=SPipe%20Self%20Review%20Admission`, and re-check that the PR still has
   `HEAD_SHA`; never accept another SHA.
5. If the provider rejects author `APPROVE`, or the actor and author are the
   same, print these steps instead of retrying. A rejection, policy denial,
   stale head, failed check, or missing protected workflow is a blocker.

Eligibility is not automatic authorization. The closed request must carry a
current user-authorization actor, timestamp, and receipt digest, and the broker
must authenticate and repeat that evidence. Ordinary reviewed code/text is
default-eligible only after that proof; operator `deny`/`constrain` records and
fixed secret/ruleset/signing/review-authority restrictions always win.
The external policy database must be the closed
`spipe-self-review-policy-db/2` JSONL contract. Both incompatible v1 shapes and
caller `self_attested` evidence fail closed; missing authority, TTL, nested
identity, canonical UTC validity, or higher-model receipt facts are never
inferred. The broker must also load separate `spipe-self-review-policy-trust/1`
with the pinned authority, Ed25519 public key, and exact whole-database digest;
self-declared keys, invalid signatures, duplicate JSON keys, invalid UTF-8/BOM,
record replacement, or tail truncation reject the database.

Constrain scopes are `code`, `text`, exact `file`, immediate
`directory_files`, and recursive `directory_recursive`. Admission binds its
expiry and requires the broker to register fail-closed check invalidation on
bound-input change or expiry. A new push, base or merge-base movement, diff
change, retarget, ruleset/policy/review/user-authorization receipt change, or
expiry requires a fresh exact-head review, authorization, and evaluation.

On the generic MCP path, call `spipe_self_review_privilege_evaluate` first. On deny, report its exact
`reason_code`, matched policy/restriction IDs, affected paths, and
`remediation`; never bypass or weaken the gate. On allow, call the
compatibility-named `spipe_self_review_approve`, which emits only the SPipe
status check and never a GitHub pull-request approval.
